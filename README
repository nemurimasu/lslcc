Currently this program takes LSL files named on the command line, parses them,
and outputs them to standard out without comments or indentation. Basically, an
LSL un-beautifier. Expressions are, AFAIK, the only things not properly parsed
into trees.

The idea is that single LSL scripts will be optimized, multiple LSL scripts will
be merged into fewer scripts, and (hopefully) scripts written in Ruby(?) will be
compiled into LSL.

Uses ANTLR for the parsing and JRuby for everything else.
